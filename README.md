# OOP-miniproject-python
Python Mini project for college


This module uses Mediapipe,OpenCV,Pycaw,numpy libraries for detecting the index finger and thumb and convert the real world coordinates into pixel coordinate and calculate the distance between the both of them; then the program converts the distance into the range 0 to 100 and that input is given to pycaw to change the volume of the system.




this project not only covers basic skills in python like OOPs, Data cleaning but also clears a future of how gesture based controlls would look like in near future. this project has immense scopes in the coming future.
